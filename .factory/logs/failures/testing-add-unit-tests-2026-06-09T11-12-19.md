# Failure: testing-add-unit-tests

**Date**: 2026-06-09T11:12:19.255Z
**Story**: /home/bigmints/projects/xtara/xtara-web/.factory/stories/features/testing-add-unit-tests.yaml
**CLI**: pi
**Files**: 357

## Failure Reason
CLI engineer consistently stalls at the file listing phase and never progresses to actual implementation. Two consecutive delegations (with different prompt structures) both resulted in the same STALL behavior — CLI outputs directory listing (~357 files) then becomes unresponsive for 600+ seconds. This appears to be a CLI agent issue rather than a prompt scope problem. The story requires creating 6 test modules (vitest config, setup file, assessment tests, auth helpers tests, firestore service tests, career helpers tests) but the CLI never advances past initial directory enumeration. Human intervention needed to either: (1) debug the CLI agent's execution environment, (2) manually scaffold the test infrastructure, or (3) decompose into much smaller atomic stories that the CLI can handle individually.
